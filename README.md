<h3> Headphone Power Requirements Calculator Site </h3>

This is a react-based website with the main purpose of calculating power requirements for headphones at different loudness levels.

Moreover, the required voltage and current for amplification are presented alongside the required power output from an amplifier.

The two main inputs include: Impedance and Sensitivity of your gear.

* Impedance - given in ohms on your audio specifications
* Sensitivity - a drop down menu allows you to select the sensitivity unit depending on the manufacturer specifications:
  * dB / mW - sensitivity in decibels per 1 milliWatt
  * dB / Vrms - sensitivity in decibels per 1 volt RMS

Calculations have been derived from [Apex Hifi](http://www.apexhifi.com/specs.html).
